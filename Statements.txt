Part A. 
Our two investigation goals were:
1. Determine the store locations with the highest revenue
2. What time of day has the highest sales

Part D.
1. With the first goal it was disovered that Redmond and Renton had the highest revenue with only a $25 difference.
 The Redmond location came out with the highest of $1082.

2. With the second goal, it was discovered that the time of the day that made the highest sales is at midnight 24:00pm - 1:00am with total sales of $436 which is almost double the amount of sales from the second highest sales which was at 2:00pm - 3:00pm with total sales of $252. Based on our discovery of this buying pattern, it indicates that our customers are most active at midnight and therefore, advertising during this time will help drive more sales.
